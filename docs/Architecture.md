# 🧩 System Architecture – Self Service UI Platform

## 1. Overview
**Self Service UI Platform** is a cloud-native self-service portal that enables developers and technical teams  
to provision, manage, and monitor infrastructure environments through an intuitive web interface.

The system is built around Kubernetes and Crossplane, allowing full Infrastructure-as-Code automation  
while exposing a clean and modern user experience via a web UI.

---

## 2. Vision
To build a **self-service platform** that empowers developers to request and manage infrastructure  
without direct DevOps intervention — reducing friction, accelerating delivery, and increasing transparency.

> “Developers should be able to create environments, databases, and cloud resources
> in minutes, with governance and automation built in.”

## 3. Core Objectives
1. **Developer Empowerment** – enable self-service provisioning within guardrails.  
2. **Operational Efficiency** – automate repetitive DevOps tasks.  
3. **Transparency & Observability** – provide clear visibility into infrastructure state.  
4. **Scalability & Modularity** – design a composable architecture for future growth.

## 4. Technology Stack
| Layer | Technology | Purpose |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| **Frontend (UI)** | Next.js + TypeScript + TailwindCSS | Web interface for users |
| **Backend (API)** | Python + FastAPI + PyYAML + Kubernetes SDK | Bridge between UI and infrastructure |
| **Infrastructure** | Crossplane + kind + YAML | Infrastructure provisioning and orchestration |
| **Container Runtime** | Docker / Docker Desktop (WSL2) | Local runtime environment |
| **Version Control** | Git + GitHub | Source management and CI/CD integration |

## 5. System Flow
[Next.js UI] → [Python API] → [Crossplane] → [Kubernetes (kind)]
1. The user interacts with the **Next.js** frontend to request infrastructure.  
2. The **FastAPI** backend interprets the request and generates YAML manifests.  
3. The backend applies these manifests to the local **Kubernetes (kind)** cluster.  
4. **Crossplane** provisions the corresponding resources.  
5. The user can monitor the status through the UI.

## 6. Long-Term Vision
- Multi-cloud support (AWS, GCP, Azure)  
- Full GitOps integration (ArgoCD / Flux)  
- Authentication and RBAC  
- Cost visibility and resource optimization
