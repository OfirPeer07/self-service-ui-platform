# 🧭 Research Topics – Developer Experience & DevOps Collaboration

## 📘 Purpose
This document complements the main `ResearchPlan.md` by providing a **detailed breakdown of the specific topics** to be explored during the research phase.  
It acts as a guide for what to investigate, where to gather insights, and how to interpret the findings.  

The focus is on understanding how **developers and DevOps teams interact**, identifying friction points, and proposing **UI-driven or automation-based solutions** that simplify these workflows.

## 1️⃣ Developer Pain Points (What Developers Struggle With)
| Area | Common Issue | Research Goal |
|------|---------------|---------------|
| **Environment Setup** | Long provisioning times, YAML complexity | Identify steps that can be automated or simplified |
| **Permissions (RBAC)** | Missing namespace access, restricted roles | Explore UI-driven role templates and safe guardrails |
| **Secrets & Configs** | Missing or outdated secrets, `.env` sync issues | Understand how secrets can be securely managed through UI |
| **GitOps / IaC** | State lock conflicts, Argo sync errors | Study where visual feedback could reduce confusion |
| **Visibility & Feedback** | No clear deployment status | Find effective ways to present real-time updates |
| **Testing Environments** | Lack of ephemeral setups or auto cleanup | Explore automated lifecycle management (TTL) |
| **YAML Fatigue** | Manual editing errors, complexity | Test how forms or wizards could simplify YAML generation |

## 2️⃣ DevOps Bottlenecks (What Slows Down Teams)
| Category | Example Problem | Research Question |
|-----------|----------------|--------------------|
| **Requests Overload** | Repetitive setup and permission requests | How can self-service tools reduce these? |
| **Governance** | Ensuring compliance while enabling autonomy | How to balance safety vs. freedom? |
| **Maintenance** | Old or unused environments piling up | What automation helps keep systems clean? |
| **Communication Gaps** | Misunderstanding between Dev & Ops | How can dashboards bridge the gap? |

## 3️⃣ UX & Developer Experience (How to Improve Interaction)
| Focus | Example Exploration | Expected Outcome |
|--------|--------------------|------------------|
| **Guided Workflows** | Step-by-step assistant for provisioning | Fewer mistakes, faster onboarding |
| **Visual Feedback** | Real-time logs & progress indicators | Higher trust, better clarity |
| **Error Surfacing** | Friendly explanations for YAML / Argo / Crossplane errors | Better learning experience |
| **Simplified Interfaces** | YAML-to-Form conversion | Easier task completion |

---

## 4️⃣ Automation & Safety (Balancing Autonomy and Control)
| Topic | Problem | Research Direction |
|--------|----------|--------------------|
| **Guardrails** | Fear of “breaking prod” | Predefined, limited-scope automation |
| **Rollback** | Hard to undo mistakes | Explore safe rollback patterns |
| **Templates** | Inconsistent configurations | Test modular YAML / UI templates |
| **Sandboxing** | Safe experimentation | Build ephemeral “dev-only” clusters |

## 6️⃣ Guiding Questions for Interviews or Forum Exploration
### For Developers:
- What slows you down when deploying or testing code?
- Which parts of DevOps do you wish you could handle yourself?
- What tools do you find too complex to use directly?
- Would you trust a UI assistant to help with your environments?

### For DevOps Engineers:
- What requests do you get repeatedly from developers?
- Which tasks do you wish developers could self-manage safely?
- What are your biggest blockers when automating infrastructure?
- How can UI tools help you monitor or control developer activity?

## 7️⃣ Expected Research Deliverables
- ✅ Categorized list of **developer & DevOps friction points**
- ✅ Prioritized list of top **pain areas for automation**
- ✅ Suggested **UI-driven or workflow-based** improvements
- ✅ Table mapping: *Problem → Simplified Solution*
